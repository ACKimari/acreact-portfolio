            <p>This Project was built and developed by a group of four individuals including me. We created it from an idea rooted in individual struggles when it comes to making decisions. Therefore, our web application is here to settle that issue for those of us who struggle with indecisiveness. Additionally our web application generates a random movie with every reset for our Movie lovers.</p>
